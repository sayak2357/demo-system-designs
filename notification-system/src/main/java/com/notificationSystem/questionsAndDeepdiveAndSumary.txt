1. How would you support retry with backoff?
ans. Add retry queue with exponential delay logic.

2. Can we support message scheduling?
ans. Add a SchedulerService and store notifications with timeStamp.

3. What if one provider fails?
ans. Add fallback provider logic(Chain of Responsibility).

4. How do you decouple retry logic?
ans. User a RetryHandler or RetryStrategy class.

5. How to monitor failures?
ans. User LoggerService, and metrics, failure counts.

Key design patterns               Strategy(Channel), Bridge(provider switching)
Extensibility hooks               Add new channels, retry strategy, multi-provider support
Core concepts used                Interface segregation, pluggable architecture, retries
Mistakes to avoid                 Hardcoding channel logic, not retrying on failure
Ideal interview wrap              "This system is modular, easy to scale, and open to extensions like scheduling or user preferences"
